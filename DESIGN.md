# Spark - Design Specification

> **"Sut-pak, Spark, 識拍火花"**  
> *AI that learns your rhythm, ignites your innovation*

## Executive Summary

This document defines the user experience design for **spark**, a terminal-based AI coding exploration agent. Following the philosophy of "learning your rhythm, igniting innovation," spark provides a Claude Code-style interface for autonomous code exploration that seamlessly integrates with developer workflows.

**Core Design Principles:**
- **Terminal-Native**: CLI-first interface that feels natural to developers
- **Non-Invasive Learning**: Learn from coding artifacts, not active monitoring  
- **Autonomous Discovery**: Nighttime exploration with morning discovery rituals
- **Workflow Integration**: Works alongside existing tools (Claude Code, IDEs, git)
- **Rhythm-Based**: Learns and respects developer work patterns

## User Research Summary

### Primary Persona: The Curious Developer
**Profile:** Software engineers, indie developers, technical explorers who code as both profession and creative pursuit.

**Core Needs:**
- **Time Efficiency**: Limited time to explore interesting coding concepts
- **Learning Continuity**: Staying current with emerging technologies without losing focus
- **Creative Exploration**: Push boundaries while maintaining productivity
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless workflow without context switching

**Usage Context:**

## Interaction Design Patterns

### Conversation Flow Design

#### Context-Aware Responses
```python
# Response adapts to user's current context and history
def generate_response(command, user_context):
    patterns = load_user_patterns()
    recent_activity = get_recent_coding_activity()
    time_context = get_current_time_context()
    
    return adaptive_response(
        command=command,
        personalization=patterns,
        recency=recent_activity, 
        timing=time_context
    )
```

#### Progressive Disclosure
```
Level 1: Essential Information (Default)
$ spark status
🧠 Learning Progress: 85% confident in your patterns
🎯 Ready for autonomous exploration

Level 2: Detailed Breakdown (On request)
$ spark status --detailed
🧠 Learning Progress (Day 12):
   • Languages: Python (67%), TypeScript (23%), Rust (10%)
   • Style: Functional-focused, explicit error handling
   • Patterns: 52 habits detected, 18 strong signals

Level 3: Technical Analysis (Power users)
$ spark patterns --technical
📊 Pattern Confidence Scores:
   • Async/await usage: 94% (237 samples)
   • Testing approach: 91% (TDD pattern detected)
   • Error handling: 89% (Result<T,E> preference)
```

### Feedback Loop Design

#### Learning Validation
```
Implicit Feedback Collection:
• Discovery integration: "spark integrate rust-pipeline" (+positive signal)
• Discovery ignoring: No action after 7 days (-neutral signal)  
• Discovery rating: "spark rate last-exploration 4/5" (explicit feedback)

Adaptive Behavior:
• High-rated discovery patterns get reinforced
• Ignored explorations reduce similar future explorations
• Integration success improves confidence in related patterns
```

#### Error Recovery Patterns
```
Graceful Degradation:
• Network issues: Fall back to cached patterns and offline mode
• Analysis failures: Provide partial results with confidence indicators
• Integration conflicts: Clear rollback instructions and safety checks

User Error Handling:
• Typo correction: "Did you mean 'spark discoveries'?" 
• Context help: Show relevant commands based on current state
• Recovery guidance: Clear next steps when operations fail
```

```python
# Spark extends CUA's callback system for learning
class SparkLearningCallback(AsyncCallbackHandler):
    async def on_file_change(self, file_path, change_type):
        # Learn from user's natural coding activity
        await self.pattern_engine.analyze_file_change(file_path)
    
    async def on_git_commit(self, commit_data):
        # Extract patterns from commit messages and changes
        await self.pattern_engine.learn_from_commit(commit_data)

# Autonomous exploration uses CUA's agent system
class SparkExplorationAgent(ComputerAgent):
    def __init__(self, user_patterns):
        super().__init__(
            model="claude-code-sdk", # Primary AI for code generation
            tools=[computer],        # CUA computer automation
            callbacks=[
                SparkDiscoveryCallback(),     # Result curation
                TrajectorySaverCallback(),    # Exploration logging
            ]
        )
        self.patterns = user_patterns
```

#### Claude Code SDK Integration
```python  
# Primary AI integration for code generation and analysis
class SparkCodeSDK:
    def __init__(self):
        self.claude_code = ClaudeCodeSDK()
        self.computer = Computer()  # CUA computer interface
        
    async def generate_exploration(self, user_patterns, focus_area):
        # Use Claude Code SDK for context-aware exploration
        project = await self.claude_code.create_experimental_project(
            patterns=user_patterns,
            focus=focus_area,
            style_preferences=user_patterns.coding_style,
            integration_context=user_patterns.project_structure
        )
        
        # Use CUA computer automation for execution
        results = await self.computer.execute_and_test(project)
        return self.curate_discovery(project, results)
```
