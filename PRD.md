# Spark - Product Requirements Document

> **"Sut-pak, Spark, 識拍火花"**  
> *AI that learns your rhythm, ignites your innovation*

## Executive Summary

**Spark** is an AI-powered coding exploration agent that learns from a developer's habits and workflow, then autonomously pushes boundaries during nighttime hours to create innovative code experiments and discoveries.

Built on the CUA (Computer Use Agent) foundation, spark combines computer automation with Claude Code SDK to create the first AI that truly learns your coding style and explores adjacent possibilities while you sleep.

**Vision**: Wake up every morning to new coding discoveries, boundary-pushing experiments, and creative explorations tailored to your interests and style.

### The Spark Philosophy

**Spark** embodies the beautiful fusion of English innovation and Hakka wisdom:

- **Spark** = *The moment of creative ignition, breakthrough, and innovation*
- **識拍 (sut-pak)** = *To know the rhythm/beat* - Understanding the unique patterns, tempo, and flow of how someone works and creates

The philosophy is profound: AI doesn't just learn what you code, but learns the deeper patterns of how you work - your creative style, your workflow habits, your development approach. Then it sparks new innovations that feel naturally attuned to your personal coding DNA.

**"Sut-pak, Spark, 識拍火花"** represents the complete cycle: learning your rhythm (sut-pak), igniting creativity (spark), recognizing the beat (識拍), and creating brilliant innovations (火花).

## Market Analysis
